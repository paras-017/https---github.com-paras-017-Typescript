// Enums : enumeration," is a data type that allows you to define a set of named constants. Enums are useful when you have a fixed set of values that a variable can take, such as days of the week, months of the year, or status codes.                --ChatGPT

/*
enum DaysofWeek {
    Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
}
let today: DaysofWeek = DaysofWeek.Wednesday;
console.log(today);
*/
  

/*   //You can also assign specific numeric values to enum constants. Here's an example:
enum Status {
    Active = 1,
    Inactive = '123jfsdi',
    Pending = 2,
}
const myStatus = Status.Pending
// const myStatus = Status.Inactive
console.log(myStatus);
